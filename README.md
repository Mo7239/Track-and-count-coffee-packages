# ☕ Coffee Package Detection and Tracking

## 📜 Description
This project utilizes **Computer Vision** techniques and the **YOLO** model to automatically detect, track, and count coffee packages on a production line. The project helps in real-time monitoring of the production process by accurately counting the number of packages produced, and can automatically stop production once a specified number of packages have been produced. This project significantly contributes to optimizing consumption and improving productivity in factories.

### Key Features:
- 🎯 **Automatic Tracking**: Detect and track coffee packages using YOLO-based object detection.
- 📊 **Counting Packages**: Count the number of coffee packages produced throughout the day.
- ⏹️ **Production Control**: Automatically stop the production line when a certain number of coffee packages are detected.
- 🎥 **Output Video**: Processed video with detected packages and tracking trails.

## 🛠️ Installation
